# BCG Data Science Job Simulation - August 2024

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work completed for the BCG Data Science Job Simulation, August 2024. The project involved performing a customer churn analysis for XYZ Analytics, where advanced data analytics skills were utilized to deliver actionable insights.

## Objectives

- **Customer Churn Analysis**: The primary goal was to analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends that could help predict churn and develop strategies to mitigate it.
- **Model Development**: A random forest model was engineered and optimized to predict customer churn, achieving an 85% accuracy rate.
- **Actionable Insights**: Insights were distilled into a concise executive summary to guide strategic decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The main programming language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Libraries used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Visualization libraries used to interpret trends and patterns in the data.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to develop and optimize the random forest model.

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis**: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in the customer data.
  - **Techniques**: Included data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualization of important trends.
  
- **Model Development**: Developed a random forest classifier to predict customer churn.
  - **Performance**: The model was optimized to achieve an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.
  - **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Executive Summary**: A concise executive summary was created to present the key findings and recommendations to the Associate Director. This summary provided actionable insights based on the analysis.

## Key Achievements

- **Advanced Data Analytics**: Demonstrated strong proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Python.
- **Model Engineering**: Successfully engineered and optimized a random forest model that provided reliable predictions on customer churn.
- **Actionable Insights**: Delivered insights that are directly applicable to strategic decision-making, focusing on customer retention and profitability.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of data science in a real-world business context, focusing on customer retention through churn prediction. The insights and models developed here are valuable tools for any business looking to minimize customer churn and maximize profitability.
